        I am from Monterey California, where I have lived my whole life. In the context of programming I am most confortable in 
        <strong>Java programming</strong> and frameworks such as <strong>Spring</strong>, but have I also know <strong>HTML, CSS, 
        and Python</strong>. Outside the realm of programming and computer science I love to garden, excerice, and almost anything that has to do with the outdoors.
